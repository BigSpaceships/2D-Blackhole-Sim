# Simulation of a photon traveling a black hole
This is in two dimensions. Repo with 3 dimension is [here](https://github.com/TODO) and initial testing was done on this private [repl](https://9e7b7783-2b54-4986-8c41-8888cce4c3c4-00-2va5xfvzjtlqq.worf.replit.dev/)

Math for the simulation is from [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2653/1/012024) by Radjaroendee, Jamraschai, and Hirunsirisawat
